        Hi, I am Thenmozhi.
        \n\n I can eat same food, day-in-day-out and not get bored.
        \n\n I can listen to same song non-stop in loop for days and still enjoy it. This freaks out all my buddies :).
        \n\n I love the fragrance of wet mud.
        \n\n I like to dream.
        \n\n I have few close friends.
        \n\n I love chocolates, in anything and everything.
        \n\n Steaming hot cup of ginger-cardamom-pepper milk-tea is my favourite beverage.
        \n\n And my Mommy\'s love transforms it into ambrosia.
        \n\n Cold coffee (light) with ice-cream comes next.
        \n\n Amongst flowers, I love the fragrance of Jasmine and Lavender.
        \n\n I like neat-n-tidy bed with a crease-less sheet on it (just like you see in your hotel rooms).
        \n\n I am practitioner of subtlety.
        \n\n I am very optimistic about my pessimismMy Belief.
        \n\n If faith in ourselves had been more extensively taught and practiced, I am sure a very large portion of the evils and miseries that we have would have vanished.
        \n\n I\'m a student of practice (just as one of my profs is Professor of the Practice).
        \n\n I think good algorithms should be like bikinisâ€¦ It should save people a lot of guesswork.
        \n\n I hate deadlines to the CORE! Because it\'s not.\n\n </string>
